# payment calculator

## Project setup

### how to run
```
npm run serve
```

### description
```
This simple loan payment calculator supports on the fly rule configuration for lenders.
The calculator allows end-users to view their loan repayments for each lender configured in the system. The lender tab is for the system admin to manage lenders (add, edit and delete) and build the loan repayment logic. Lenderâ€™s loan repayment logic can be dynamically created as per their custom matrics and order of the respective payment logic. 

```

### how long did you spend creating the application
```
I had to work on few different time slots and all together it should be around 6+ hrs.
```

### any assumptions made
```
As per the exercise, only 3 different payment calculation methods are integrated into the system. Input validation, error handling, and automated tests are not included in the solution due to the limited time I spent on this.
```

### any queries that need resolving
```
"repayments in arrears only" Not sure how this relate to the exercise
```

### what part of the application are you most proud of (if any)
```
I managed to develop the solution in a way you can create custom rules on the go.
```

### any improvements you would make
```
If there is a next level, I would make the rule inputs configured in the rule type itself and dynamically render inputs on rule management view.
